After the incredible success of our inaugural event at Paradox in Margazhi '23, we took things to the next level with an exciting new edition focused on programming, AI, and ML. Open to students of all levels, this time we welcomed over 600 participants on campus, all eager to compete for a prize pool of 15K! The event was a whirlwind of mind-bending challenges designed to test not just technical skills, but also creativity and critical thinking. Participants pushed the limits of problem-solving, thinking outside the box and breaking through the boundaries of conventional wisdom. It was an inspiring and electrifying experience, where innovation and collaboration took center stage.
